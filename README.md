# Object-Tracking
Object Tracking with Lukas Kanade algorithm where we define a template by drawing a bounding box around the object to be tracked in the first frame of the video. For each of the subsequent frames the tracker will update an affine transform that warps the current frame so that the template in the first frame is aligned with the warped current frame.
